# Research interests
I'm interested in how environments have shaped us. I'm now preparing an evolutionary robotics approach for this purpose.

During my undergraduate and master's study, my research focused on reinforcement learning (RL), a sub-area of artificial intelligence on agents that try to maximize some utility (called *reward*) in complex environments.
I authored two papers about generalization and reward-free skill acquisition in RL.

# OSS Projects
I am a fan of open sources and open communities since I met the
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community during my undergraduate.
I have continuosly contributed to some OSS projects, although I am not
very active now.
I received
[Google Open Source Peer Bonus](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html)
for my contributions to [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

See my Github account for more.
