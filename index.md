# Research Interests
 I am interested in collective intelligence in its broadest sense, but with a particular focus on human group dynamics. I aim to develop principled understandings that can bridge the gap between individual and collective-level behaviors/computations, currently employing a combination of game-theoretic experiments and computational modeling.
